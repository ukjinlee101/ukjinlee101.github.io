# Ukjin Lee

Hello! I am a Ph.D. student at **Stanford University**, working on **Advanced AI Agent Architectures**.

My research focuses on building agents that can reason, plan, and act in complex environments. I am particularly interested in how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be leveraged for decision-making tasks.

Previously, I completed my B.S. at **MIT** and interned at **Google DeepMind** and **Facebook (Meta)**.

You can find my CV [here]({{ "/cv" | relative_url }}) and read my latest blog posts [here]({{ "/blog" | relative_url }}).

*   **Dec 2023**: Presented my paper on "Efficient Exploration" at NeurIPS 2023.
*   **Summer 2023**: Interned at Google DeepMind in London.
