Welcome to my new academic website! This blog will document my research journey and share tutorials on machine learning and AI agents.

## MathJax Support

This site supports $\LaTeX$ equations through MathJax. For example, here is the definition of the KL divergence:

$$ D_{KL}(P || Q) = \sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} P(x) \log \left( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \right) $$

And inline equations like $E = mc^2$ work seamlessly.

## Code Highlighting

We also have syntax highlighting for code blocks. Here is a simple Python example:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print([fibonacci(i) for i in range(10)])
```

Stay tuned for more updates!
